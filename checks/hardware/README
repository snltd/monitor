The scripts in this directory shouldn't be run manually, only through the
snltd_auditor.sh master script. It sets vital variables.

Here are the guidelines for coding.

Check scripts are named check_<test>, and don't print anything, they just
exit with a code which tells the master script something. Exit codes are:

 0 : the test was passed - no fault
 1 : the test failed
 2 : the test could not be run
 3 : the test ran, but results were ambiguous

Software scritps go in the software/ directory, hardware scripts in
hardware/ and operating system scripts in os/.

Diagnostic scripts are named diag_<test>, and are only executed when the
corresponding check_ script has returned 1. 

The master script can pick up scripts for specific platforms if they follow
this naming convention.

  check_<test>.<platform>.sh
  diag_<test>.platform.sh

where <platform> is the output of uname -i on the machine you have tailored
the tesst for.
